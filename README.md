# Transformers-in-Depression-Detection-from-Semi-Structured-Psychological-Interviews

This repository is a collection of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) consisting on the training of different models for depression assesment

The whole code, is the result of a final Master's Thesis of the [Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence](http://www.upc.edu/master/fitxa_master.php?id_estudi=50&lang=esp) supervised by Jordi Vitrià, and from AcceXible, Javi Jiménez and Alberto Coca. The report is published in this repository as well. 

## Abstract 

The expansive adoption of Transformer models across the Machine Learning land-
scape is undeniable, and health is not an exception. This study undertakes a rigorous
exploration of the efficacy of these novel architectures in discerning depression in-
dicators from semi-structured psychological interviews. A key focus of this study
is the extrapolation of the pre-training knowledge inherent in these models, and the
comparison with traditional state-of-the-art Machine Learning models. In doing so,
the thesis proposes a comprehensive framework designed to facilitate objective com-
parison. The study extends its inquiry into the differential performance of text and
speech modalities, in isolation and combination, within the context of depression
detection. Moreover, this research delves into the importance of topical relevance
in the detection process, culminating in an evaluative discussion of crucial themes
integral to accurate depression detection. Ultimately, this thesis contributes to the
deepening understanding of the complex interplay between Transformer models,
modality use, and topic importance in the realm of depression detection.
